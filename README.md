# RecommendationEngine

A versatile recommendation system that leverages collaborative filtering techniques to provide personalized recommendations based on user preferences and behavior patterns.

## Overview

This recommendation engine implements a collaborative filtering approach to analyze user behavior and generate tailored recommendations. The system works by identifying patterns in user interactions with items and finding similarities between users to suggest relevant content.

## Features

- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements user-based and item-based collaborative filtering
- **Personalized Recommendations**: Generates recommendations tailored to individual user preferences
- **Scalable Architecture**: Designed to handle large datasets efficiently
- **Customizable Parameters**: Allows fine-tuning of recommendation algorithms based on specific needs
- **Cross-Platform Compatibility**: Works across different environments and data sources

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/RohitJishtu/RecommendationEngine.git

# Navigate to the directory
cd RecommendationEngine

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```python
from recommendation_engine import RecommendationEngine

# Initialize the engine with your dataset
engine = RecommendationEngine(data_path='path/to/your/data.csv')

# Train the model
engine.train()

# Get recommendations for a specific user
recommendations = engine.get_recommendations(user_id=123, num_recommendations=5)
print(recommendations)
```

## Configuration

You can customize the recommendation algorithm by modifying the parameters in the configuration file:

```python
# Example configuration
config = {
    'similarity_metric': 'cosine',  # Options: 'cosine', 'pearson', 'euclidean'
    'neighborhood_size': 50,        # Number of similar users/items to consider
    'min_ratings': 5,               # Minimum number of ratings required
    'regularization': 0.1,          # Regularization parameter for matrix factorization
    'factors': 100                  # Number of latent factors
}

engine = RecommendationEngine(config=config)
```

## Data Format

The recommendation engine expects data in the following format:

```
user_id, item_id, rating, timestamp
1, 101, 5.0, 1622548800
1, 102, 3.5, 1622635200
2, 101, 4.0, 1622721600
...
```

## Evaluation Metrics

The system provides several metrics to evaluate recommendation quality:

- RMSE (Root Mean Square Error)
- MAE (Mean Absolute Error)
- Precision and Recall
- Coverage
- Diversity
